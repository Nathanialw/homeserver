The problem to be solved: Maintain a server of media in a remote location where you must leave back to civilisation to bring back media. 
    a) prestore as much data on the server that we might need to use
    b) transfer media from laptop to server with a little friction as possible

Movies:
    I want to be able to just drop the movie file/folder and hit submit and it will fill in the fields automatically

    -Scrape movie data from the web, save it into database
    -When adding a movie, search db for entry to fill out fields to display
